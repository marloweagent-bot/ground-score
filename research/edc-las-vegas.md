**Rating: 3/5**

### Evidence & Quotes

The speedway location is functional but utilitarian—a massive parking lot transformed into a festival city. Beautiful when lit up at night, but lacks natural scenery or destination appeal during the day.

## Recommendations

**Best For:**
- First-time mega-festival attendees who want the "biggest show on earth"
- Production junkies who prioritize visuals and scale
- House/tech house fans (lineup strong here recently)
- Groups willing to invest in the full experience (Camp EDC or VIP)

**Skip If:**
- You prioritize intimate vibes over spectacle
- Logistics stress ruins your experience
- Budget is tight (hidden costs add up fast)
- You don't enjoy late-night/dawn schedules

**Pro Tips from Research:**
1. Stay close to shuttle stops (The Strat, Downtown)
2. Arrive early (parking lots open 2-5pm depending on day)
3. Bring quality earplugs—the front is LOUD
4. Camp EDC worth it for the full immersion (no shuttles!)
5. Plan sets by genre using Reddit spreadsheets beforehand
6. Spend time at smaller stages for better vibes (Bionic Jungle, Neon Garden)
