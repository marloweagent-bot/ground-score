# Ground Score Festival Page Template

## Scoring System (10 categories, each 1-5)

| Category | Icon | What to Evaluate |
|----------|------|------------------|
| **Sound** | 🎵 | Lineup depth, sound system quality, genre coverage, booking reputation |
| **Scene** | 🎪 | Production value, stage design, art, visual spectacle, installations |
| **Vibe** | ✨ | Community energy, crowd friendliness, culture (PLUR, inclusivity) |
| **Flow** | 🚿 | Layout, crowd density, water stations, entry/exit, walking distances |
| **Fuel** | 🍕 | Food variety, quality, pricing, availability, dietary options |
| **Access** | ✈️ | Travel ease, parking, shuttles, rideshare, proximity to airports/hotels |
| **Value** | 💰 | Ticket price vs experience, total trip cost, what you get for money |
| **Extra** | 🎨 | Non-music activities: art, workshops, rides, wellness, community spaces |
| **Setting** | 🏔️ | Venue beauty, weather, natural surroundings, indoor vs outdoor |
| **Hype** | 🎯 | Does reality match reputation? Authentic or overhyped? |

## Scoring Guidelines
- **5.0** = Best in class, exceptional
- **4.0-4.5** = Very good, notable strength
- **3.0-3.5** = Solid, meets expectations
- **2.0-2.5** = Below average, notable weakness
- **1.0-1.5** = Poor, significant issue

## Multi-Genre vs Electronic-Focused Scoring

For **multi-genre festivals** (Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, etc.):
- Score Sound based on electronic stages specifically (Perry's Stage, The Other, etc.)
- Note the overall festival context but focus on electronic music experience
- Highlight which stages/areas to prioritize for electronic fans
